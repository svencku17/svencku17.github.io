						<p>I’m Monika, lithuanian girl with an international mindset. Studies in Denmark, participation in various cultural projects, 10 years of experience in martial arts, working in many organizational spheres positively affected my personality and lifestyle.Martial art trainings prepared myself to the biggest “ring” that is called LIFE. Now I can describe myself as open-minded, energetic, the one that always dreams big and seeks for the highest standards in personal growth. Therefore, healthy trends, active lifestyle, balanced and nutritious food, morning yoga with running and continuous self-development are an integral part of my life.</p>
						<p> Hi, I am Aneta.
I am from Lithuania (born in Russia) and living in Ireland. I know .. it sounds complicated! Isn’t it?
I started my Karate journey being at age of 7 in Lithuania. From my very first training, I understood, that this is my favourite sport!
I love everything about it.
Now, after more than 20 years, I am still actively practising it.. Mostly in Ireland, but always in touch with my Lithuanian coaches and teammates.
Karate for me is more than a sport and I find it useful for many aspects in our day to day life..
I am not only an athlete, also, I am a wife and a mother. And my 2 sons practising karate too and while I am coaching them my goal is to explain them how this sport affected me and my life. How it teached me of discipline, respect and dedication and just imortant basics for my life.</p>
